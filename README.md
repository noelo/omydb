# OMYDB

OpenShift resource linter - enforce consistency on k8s/OCP resources

Intended to be used as part of a CI/CD pipeline to ensure resource consistency. 
Jenkins and Tekton need to be supported

## Policies
* Are health check and readiness probes declared
* Validate counts and timeouts for probes - Ensure liveness & readiness probes times/timeouts are not too short
* Deployment replica count is < 1
* Are the two health checks pointing to the same endpoint (antipattern)
* Are there limits assigned to the pods (memory, cpu, others), are those limits too large ?
* Are there prescriptive labels assigned
* Is the service account defined ?
* Is there annotations for driving prometheus metrics scraping
* Is the java XMS XMX settings greater than the pod limits
* Are secrets in a consistent place on the pod FS
* Warn if are secrets mounted as environment variables.
* Are services exposed on consistent ports
* Volumes not defined or defined and not mounted
* Warnings on pulling image with latest tag
* Warnings on route name definitions e.g. DNS subdomains etc
* Pull images and report on image sizes, set maximum allowed
* Warnings on OCP/K8s api versions being used
* Warnings on deprecated API resources
* Check consistency of resources e.g. using an non-default SA, where is the SA definition
* Ensuring that base images are used and up to date
* Are there pod disruption budgets used
* Service selectors match pod labels
* Check that default SA secrets are not being mounted or if so that there is a label/annotation
* Warning on pulling images directly rather than using image streams
* Warning on using DeploymentConfigs rather than Deployments if no hooks configured
* Generic warning on using OCP resources over K8s resources if not required
* Generic warning if custom SA is defined but not used in DC/Deployment
* Warning if PVC defined but not used
* Warning is resource request and limits are inverted
* Warning using local storage volumes as this will impact workload placement
* Warning using host networks
* More to be added
* K8s recommended labels https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/

Potentially resource annotation can be added to enable tests to be skipped (TBD).

Definition of rules can be retrived from an endpoint e.g. http, file etc
